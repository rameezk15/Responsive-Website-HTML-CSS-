# Responsive-Website-HTML-CSS-
This is my first responsive website.

I am phasing a issue to create responsive ".sidebar".
1) Text is not at centre it goes outside in ABOUT page.
2) Form is also not aligned at the centre in Service page.

And "#navbar" is aslo not that much responsive as i expected. I thought its not at centre properly
